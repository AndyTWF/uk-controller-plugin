# Updating The UK Controller Plugin

This page provides information about updating the UK Controller Plugin to the latest version. We usually maintain support for a few versions of the plugin
at any one time, this is to allow people time to update as they please and also to allow us to improve functionality over time.

## How will I know an update is available?

When an update for the UK Controller Plugin is released, the plugin will notify you that an update is available when it is loaded in EuroScope. To get the update, please follow
these steps:

- Close EuroScope
- Go to the [download page](https://community.vatsim.uk/files/downloads/file/215-uk-controller-plugin/) and download the latest version.
- Replace the plugin DLL that you had previously with the newly download one
- Restart EuroScope

If you have successfully updated, you should no longer receive a notification that the plugin is outdated.

## The plugin is telling me that it has been withdrawn

If you see a message on startup that the plugin has been withdrawn, then it means you are running a version that is either too old to be supported, or has a bug and so the
division has prevented it from being used to stop the bug from potentially causing unintended side-effects on the VATSIM network.

If this happens, don't panic! Just follow the update guide above to install the latest version of the plugin.
