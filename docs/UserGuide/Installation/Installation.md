# Installation Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to install the UK Controller Plugin.

## Requirements

In order to use the UK Controller Plugin, you need to download the Visual C++ Redistributables (x86) from Microsoft.

**Note:** You must download the x86 (32 bit) version of the redistributables. The plugin will not work with the x64 (64 bit) version as EuroScope is a 32 bit program only.

## Installation

Please visit the [UK Controller Plugin Website](https://vatsim.uk/ukcp) for a comprehensive setup guide.
