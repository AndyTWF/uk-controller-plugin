# Updating The UK Controller Plugin

This page provides information about updating the UK Controller Plugin to the latest version. We usually maintain support for a few versions of the plugin
at any one time, this is to allow people time to update as they please and also to allow us to improve functionality over time.

## Updating

When the UK Controller Plugin is loaded, it will check for any available updates and, if available, install these updates automatically.

When updates have been completed, the plugin will notify you and offer you an opportunity to open the [Changelog](../Changelog/Changelog.md) which
contains details of what's changed between versions.

## What happens if the update fails?

If the UK Controller Plugin fails to update or check for updates, the plugin will inform you as to why. If you have
a previous version of the plugin installed, it will attempt to use that version.
