# UK Controller Plugin

The UK Controller Plugin is an extension to EuroScope version 3.2 to aid controllers in VATSIM UK with their controlling duties. The system comprises of two essential parts, 
the EuroScope plugin (this library) and a central [web API](https://github.com/VATSIM-UK/uk-controller-api) which coordinates instances of the plugin and manages shared data, 
for example, stand allocations.
